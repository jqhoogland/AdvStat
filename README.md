## Contents
The course provides you with a basic understanding of the logic and mechanisms of Frequentist and Bayesian inference. Although some of the concepts are abstract on first sight, they form the bedrock of almost any statistical reasoning that that you will encounter in and outside of the academic world. You will learn under what circumstances standard statistical methods and prescriptions that you might have seen already in other courses actually work as intended, and when they fail. The examples that I will provide are oriented towards particle physics and astronomy.

## Recommended prior knowledge
Good knowledge of 'Statistical Methods' (Uttley) is highly recommended. Many of the exercises will require the use of the programming language Python, which is also used in Uttl
